Hi, my name is **Sarthak** and I am an aspiring Deep Learning Engineer!

I'm passionate about the field and how AI possesses the ability to greatly increase the quality of our lives. My interest in the field was developed by some of the pioneers in the field, such as **Ilya Sutskever**, **Andrew Ng** and **Andrej Karpathy**.

Through this blog, I will be sharing my personal thoughts on AI as well as any research or projects I conduct.

I hope you find this blog interesting and maybe even learn something new :blush:
